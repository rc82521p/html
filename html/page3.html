 		<h1>Work Experience <h/h1>
 		<p>I have had a few jobs in my life the first being in a clinic where we specialized in sexually transmitted disease prevention and help. I worked there from when I was 16 to when I was 17 and then when I got to college I started working at the Pace Calling Center where I was promoted to supervisor a year in. I have also had a few smaller jobs in the summer like working at a chop shop and working with my friends fathers moving company. </p>

 		<h2> Memorable Stories <h/h1>
 		<p> In my first job my most memorable experience was going on a job retreat to Pennsylvania where a few cities that had similiar clinic programs also attended. It was memorable because we were the last group to get their and we were treated like celebrities because we were from NYC. Another story about my second and current job was visiting the PLV campus last semester. Most of the employees had never visited the other campus and it was nice to see the other half of Pace University since it was almost nothing like the city campus it was almost like an entire different school.</p>
