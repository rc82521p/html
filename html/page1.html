		<h1>Hi, everyone my name is Ricky<h/h1>
		<p> I am a junior studying Information Systems.<br/>I work at the Pace Call Center and have been there since my freshman year. </p>
		<hr/>
		<p> When I am not in school or working I like to exercise or play baseball or basketball but since I usually don’t get to because of school I watch them on TV.<br/> I am an avid Yankees and Knicks fan and try to watch and attend as many games in a season as I can </p>
		<hr/>
		<p> When I graduate with my Bachelors I hope to have a well paying job and be able to go to graduate school and go for a masters in Internet Technology. </p>
